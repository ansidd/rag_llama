2600 B.C.
The Beginnings of Cancer Treatment
As early as 2600 B.C., Egyptian physician Imhotep used the body’s immune system to fight cancer by inducing an infection. According to the Ebers Papyrus, the recommended treatment for tumors was a poultice, which is a soft, moist mass of material that typically contains herbs and is placed on the skin to relieve soreness and inflammation. This was followed by an incision to facilitate the development of infection in the desired location and cause regression of the tumor.
Mid-18th Century
The Beginnings of Hematology
English surgeon and apothecary William Hewson, sometimes referred to as the “Father of Hematology,” publishes detailed studies that provide the basis of understanding on red and white blood cells. His findings show that fibrinogen – a protein in blood plasma – leads to coagulation and would eventually drive a greater understanding of the lymphatic system and inflammatory reactions"
1882
Radical Surgery to Remove Tumors
Following the invention of anesthesia, three surgeons, Dr. Theodor Billroth, Dr. William Halsted and Dr. William Handley, lead the charge in cancer operations to remove the entire tumor with lymph nodes. Dr. Billroth is considered a pioneer of gastric cancer surgery while Dr. Halsted introduces the first radical mastectomy for breast cancer, based on the work from Dr. William Handley, who believed cancer spread outward by invasion from the original growth. For the first half of the 20th century, surgery is the only option for cancer treatment.
1891
The Origins of Modern Immunotherapy: William B. Coley, M.D.
Dr. William B. Coley uses killed bacteria, called “Coley’s Toxins,” to stimulate an immune response to attack and shrink tumors in patients.
1898
Discovery of Radiation Therapy
Physicists Marie and Pierre Curie discover a chemical element known as radium, which is later shown to be an effective treatment for cancer in small doses. This discovery continues to serve as the basis of modern radiation treatment used today.
