Key takeaway messages
Communities globally are struggling to support growing healthcare needs. There are numerous challenges such as balancing efficiency with quality of care and outcomes, a growing aging population, and an increase of people living with chronic conditions. Global health systems must also be ready to respond to disruptions such as large-scale public health emergencies or a pandemic.
BMS drives high-impact partnerships globally to strengthen healthcare systems by prioritizing inclusive innovation, patient access, and influencing global decisionmakers to advocate for improved and equitable access to care.
BMS partners with organizations across sectors – ranging from trade groups to multi-stakeholder partnerships such as Access Accelerated, All.Can, and City Cancer Challenge.
A core tenet of Bristol Myers Squibb’s approach to strengthening health systems is through building healthcare capability through various mechanisms such as healthcare professional training and patient/community education. Through key partnerships, BMS has mobilized technical expertise and on-the-ground partners globally to design and implement solutions to supply chain management, primary care, and digital health needs.
