Performance
Our performance can be measured in two ways. The most important measure of our success as a global biopharmaceutical company is the difference we make in the lives of patients. In tandem, our ability to ensure the sustainability of our business is often measured by our sales growth.
Our products are sold principally to the wholesale and retail trade. Certain products are also sold to other drug manufacturers, hospitals and the medical profession. Bristol Myers Squibb is also committed to improving
access
to our medicines for patients who are unable to afford them.
In 2017, we invested $4.8* billion on pharmaceutical Research and Development, an amount that represents 23.1% percent of our pharmaceutical sales.
