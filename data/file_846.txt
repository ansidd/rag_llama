The Bristol Myers Squibb Network of Women (B-NOW) drives business performance by ensuring that all women at Bristol Myers Squibb have equal opportunities to develop, advance and be retained globally.

What I do
I am the General Manager for Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, where I lead a team of amazingly talented colleagues that ensure that HCPs and payers have all the information they need to provide Bristol Myers Squibb medicines to the people who will benefit the most.

“This is a company that has stepped into their commitment of ensuring diversity and inclusivity. From day one I knew that here, I matter - and that I have chosen to work for a company that is living up to the values they have espoused.” ~ Stephanie Dyson, Vice President of U.S. Policy & Government Affairs
What do you do at Bristol Myers Squibb?
I serve as the Vice President of U.S Policy & Government Affairs where I have the pleasure of leading a team of distinguished and dedicated professionals. I serve as a strategic advisor, business leader and collaborative partner by advising the CEO, leadership,and the enterprise on the implications of U.S. legislation and policy in this evolving market. In this position, I am accountable for creating and leading strategic outcomes that are aligned with enterprise-wide business priorities and place an emphasis on patient access and innovation.
One way I’ve become more involved with the culture is by joining B-NOW.  B-NOW provides support, networking opportunities and ways to connect with colleagues for both personal and professional development. For example, I recently served as the moderator for a B-NOW workgroup session with Cecilia Muñoz, who served for eight years on President Obama’s senior staff, as Director of Intergovernmental Affairs and Director of the Domestic Policy Council. She spoke on the issue of equality and gave insights into her book “Being the First: How to Lay the Groundwork for Equality.”
What makes Bristol Myers Squibb a great place to work?
What people want most in this world is to know they are valued and that they matter. At Bristol Myers Squibb, I have the privilege of showing up as my authentic self, which is in part because I’m a “seasoned” professional, but more importantly, because this is a company that has stepped into their commitment of ensuring diversity and inclusivity. From day one I knew that here, I matter - and that I have chosen to work for a company that is living up to the values they have espoused.
As women, we have unique perspectives and experiences and we should celebrate and value our unique journey. I’m proud that Bristol Myers Squibb has been intentional and purposeful by empowering every person to dream more, to achieve more and to ensure every person knows they are valued. It’s powerful to see women and women of color at every level of the organization from the Executive Leadership team to ALL levels of management. I recently attended a meeting comprised of our top leaders and looking around the room I realized that it was a defining moment in my career - I was not alone. There was a palpable energy and realization that the isolation often felt by being the only one (woman, minority, African American) in the room is potentially in our rear-view mirror.  We still have a long way to go in corporate America, but Bristol Myers Squibb is leading the way!
What would you say to someone thinking about working at Bristol Myers Squibb?
Bristol Myers Squibb feeds my passion and purpose! As a registered nurse, it’s imperative that I work for a company that is patient-centric and values me as a person, not just an employee - and Bristol Myers Squibb checks both boxes. The icing on the cake is the impressive portfolio and pipeline we have. It’s exciting working for a cutting-edge company on the edge of innovation – it ensures work is challenging and rewarding, yet fun!

“At BMS, you’ll be valued for who you are, you’ll be encouraged to unleash your full potential while working for patients and delivering on something bigger than you.” ~ Aissata Camara, Associate Director, Value-based Healthcare Strategy & Operations
What I do
I joined Bristol Myers Squibb 11 years ago. Currently I am working as part of a team designing and implementing programs aimed to deliver greater value to patients and bring more efficiency to the French healthcare system. I have also served in various positions across marketing, sales, market access and the Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation. Additionally, I am the B-NOW France chapter lead. We launched the French chapter of B-NOW with very specific positioning that fosters the advancement of women and recognizes the role men play. With this deliberately inclusive positioning we are encouraging and inviting men to actively engage with gender diversity issues. Our goal is to break down invisible barriers that prevent people from realizing their full potential by focusing on three-pillars: raising awareness about bias and stereotypes, sharing inspirational stories and promoting personal and professional development.
What makes Bristol Myers Squibb a great place to work?
Bristol Myers Squibb values their employees and creates conditions for them to seize opportunities! Over the course of my career at Bristol Myers Squibb, three unique qualities have particularly stood out to me:
Flexible work environment: When I joined Bristol Myers Squibb France 11 years ago, I was the young mother of a 5-month-old baby. For more flexibility, they offered to let me work remotely during my very first month at the company.
Trust & encouragement: Shortly after joining, I applied for a six-month assignment in Lisbon, Portugal. While I was apprehensive of the idea of taking on more responsibility, I was inspired by my manager’s advice: “Yes, you’ll be stretched, but you’ll make it,” she said. “Listen to your intuition and just believe in yourself.”
Opportunity: Over the course of my 11-year career here, I have had the opportunity to serve in six different roles across a number of different sectors! This has allowed me to widen my expertise and given me a deeper understanding into the different aspects of the work we do each day.
I am proud of working and growing at Bristol Myers Squibb for so many years because of the meaning and the impact of my day-to-day work on patients’ lives.
What would you say to someone thinking about working at Bristol Myers Squibb?
At Bristol Myers Squibb, you’ll be valued for who you are, you’ll be encouraged to unleash your full potential while working for patients and delivering something bigger than yourself.
