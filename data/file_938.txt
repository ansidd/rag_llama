Zero8Hundred will receive $396,561 over two years to expand the Military Transition Support Project and implement a comprehensive program focused on supporting transitioning military families.
Need
It is clear that veterans require a comprehensive model to improve access to a multitude of resources for wrap-around support as they transition out of the military. The Zero8hundred program is a resource hub that utilizes both a web portal and Peer Navigators to connect transitioning service members and their families to existing vetted services and resources available for support.
Project
Zero8hundred 2.0 will pilot the community reintegration model and measure outcomes with three additional branches of the armed services in two counties, including US Army, US Air Force, Reserves and National Guard members, as well as evaluate the model with service members and their families who are reintegrating in different geographic areas from their military command. The grant will support the behavioral health needs of these families with individualized and intensive peer navigation assistance, assessment and strategic interventions for their psychological well-being.
