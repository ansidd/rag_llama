Patient & employee stories: A Letter From Our CEO, Chris Boerner, PhD
At Bristol Myers Squibb, we are working together for patients.
In fact, our mission is clear—we discover, develop and deliver innovative medicines that help people prevail over serious diseases. And our sense of urgency is real—we work every day in every part of our company to make a meaningful difference in the lives of our patients.
It’s what we do. Our patients are why we do it.
We are proud of the work we do. And proud of the employees who embody and give expression to our mission and who are driven by an urgency to serve our patients. We are likewise inspired by our patients, whose courage and determination to prevail never ceases to amaze us.
We have asked some of our employees and patients to share their experiences and inspiring stories with the world.  Employees and patients, including David, Eric, Adrienne, Kena, Alica, and many others. Their words are personal and powerful, and together they help tell the Bristol Myers Squibb story and show what we are all about.
Thank you for your interest in Bristol Myers Squibb.
Chris Boerner, PhD
