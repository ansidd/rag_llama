Improve recognition of cancer cells
The immune system naturally defends and protects the body against infection, involving a complex network of cells and signaling molecules. Bristol Myers Squibb is investigating multiple pathways and targets with the aim of amplifying the ability of the immune system to recognize and eliminate cancer cells.

Prevent immunosuppression
The tumor microenvironment (TME) contains cells and signaling molecules that suppress an anti-tumor immune response. Bristol Myers Squibb is investigating ways to block the tumor’s ability to recruit immunosuppressive cell types to the TME and inhibit signaling that contributes to immunosuppression.
CCR8
IL-8
JNK
CCR8
CCR8
is a protein found mainly on the surface of regulatory T cells (Tregs) within tumors and is a regulator of immune response. 1,2
CCR8 is upregulated on a highly immunosuppressive subset of Tregs in multiple cancer types. 2,3
Targeting CCR8 with an antibody to selectively eliminate Tregs within the TME has the potential to facilitate productive anti-tumor immunity.

Enhance effector cell function
Cancer cells can suppress effector cells (short-lived activated cells of the immune system), but these cells can also be modified to mount a cytotoxic attack. Bristol Myers Squibb is investigating ways to increase the ability of effector cells to act on cancer cells, direct cytotoxic activity toward cancer cells and engineer cell therapies that exhibit continued anti-cancer activity.
