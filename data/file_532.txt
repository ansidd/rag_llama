Shrinking a cancer cell in Berlin's central station
#wefightcancer installation symbolizes the ongoing fight to end cancer
February 19, 2018
An oversized, life-like model of a cancer cell housed in a glass box might not be the kind of thing one expects to see on the bustling, main floor of one of Europe’s busiest train stations.
Bristol Myers Squibb Germany launched a unique cancer awareness installation in Berlin's central station, featuring an oversized, life-like model of a cancer cell.
But when an estimated 350,000 travelers and rushed commuters pass through Berlin’s main train station this week alone, they will encounter a unique cancer-awareness installation launched by Bristol Myers Squibb Germany.
Marking the 33rd annual German Cancer Congress, the country’s oldest and largest cancer meeting, the Bristol Myers Squibb #wefightcancer (#gemeinsamgegenkrebs) campaign asks people to stop by the installation and press a buzzer to symbolically help in the fight against cancer. Over the course of the four-day congress, the cancer cell model housed in a glass box will shrink slowly, bit by bit.
Individuals may also participate in the campaign by sharing the #wefightcancer hashtag on Twitter.
Each interaction via the buzzer or on Twitter will be tracked.
“We hope that by the end of the campaign the cell will be as small as it can possibly be, just as one day we hope cancer will disappear,” said Michael May, medical director for Bristol Myers Squibb Germany.
“This installation is our reminder that we must continue to research and fight, in order to improve outcomes for cancer patients,” he added.
The campaign’s Twitter hashtag is #wefightcancer.
