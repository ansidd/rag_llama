Contributing to a healthy environment
Across the globe, Bristol Myers Squibb is committed to being a responsible global citizen and we set ambitious sustainability goals to take our commitment to economic growth, social responsibility and a healthy environment to the next level.
Contributing to a Healthy Environment
We recently announced achievements against our  Sustainability 2015 Goals  and are proud to share how we’ve worked to reduce our environmental footprint in our pursuit of discovering, developing and delivering innovative medicines that help patients prevail over serious diseases. And we’re now hard at work to achieve and potentially surpass our new  Sustainability 2020 Goals .
In late 2016, we opened our state-of-the-art Princeton Pike facility in Lawrence Township, New Jersey. Designed and built to Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold (application pending) specifications, the building features a number of environmentally sustainable features.
