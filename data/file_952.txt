Family AIDS Caring Trust
Family AIDS Caring Trust (FACT) is a Christian organization in Mutare, Zimbabwe. Through partnerships with communities and officials, FACT implements projects to improve public health.
Need
Despite progress in managing HIV and AIDS in national programs to prevent mother-to-child transmission, Africa still bears the greatest burden of child and maternal deaths from the disease.
Project
FACT will build upon their existing platforms to focus on primary prevention of HIV among future parents, provide family planning education among HIV-positive mothers, and incorporate nurse practitioners in community healthcare delivery.
FACT has established a low-cost rural cancer screening center and will work with three health centers in Chiredzi, Zimbabwe to implement a prevention of mother-to-child transmission program and low-cost See and Treat cervical cancer screening services.
The program aims to reach 6,000 women, including 500 pregnant women and their spouses, and train 60 secondary caregivers and 30 village health workers. Through a strong referral system the program will ensure that residents who test positive for HIV receive treatment.
