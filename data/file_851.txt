Our statement on recent developments in the U.S. affecting the LGBTQ+ community
As a company focused on transforming patient lives through science, we strongly support the equal treatment of all colleagues and do not tolerate discrimination of any kind. Our long-standing policies against harassment and discrimination extend to sexual orientation and gender identity and expression for our global workforce.  We provide equal opportunities for employment, advancement and access to leave for all of our employees.
We applaud the recent U.S. Supreme Court extension of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to prohibit discrimination in employment based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The Supreme Court decision is a positive step, but we recognize that there is still work to be done, as LGBTQ+ people continue to face discrimination in many areas of life.
We were deeply disappointed by the recent decision by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to reverse protections for LGBTQ+ individuals from discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sex stereotyping. We oppose discrimination in the healthcare system and ensure our U.S. healthcare plans offered to our employees are administered in a non-discriminatory manner. We are doing our part to stand against similar discriminatory practices globally.
Our company will continue to advocate for what we believe in, including support for our diverse workforce, patients and worldwide population. Our values are key to living our mission and delivering for patients.
