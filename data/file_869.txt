LUNGevity
LUNGevity received $636,235 over 2 years to implement Project ACTS (Adherence to CT Screening), a collaboration between academics, clinicians, and a patient advocacy group that aims to increase adherence to follow-up low-dose computerized tomography (CT) screening for those high-risk individuals who represent with lung nodules in their initial scan, or who do not present with nodules in the initial scan but require annual follow-up, by developing a procedure and tool for the screening centers responsible for patient follow-up.
Need
Currently, more than 200 screening centers in the US offer lung cancer screening. Success of these preventive screening programs is contingent on adequate adherence to required follow-up procedures. Studies indicate that as many as 45% of screening program participants may not receive/seek a follow-up scan after an abnormal scan. Additionally, as few as 30% of individuals return for their recommended annual screening after completing a baseline screening that was pathology free.
