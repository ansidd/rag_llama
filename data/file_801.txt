Kim Jablonski
Chief Compliance & Ethics Officer
Kim Jablonski was named chief compliance & ethics officer in October 2023. She is charged with leading a global team dedicated to fostering Bristol Myers Squibb’s culture of Integrity. Under Kim’s guidance, Compliance & Ethics provides business leaders with support to manage compliance risk and effectively operationalize well-informed decisions that are consistent with global laws and regulations, and our Principles of Integrity.
“Compliance is more than regulatory obligations and following guidelines. It’s about making it easy for your people to do the right thing,” said Kim. “As an industry, we are developing medicines that can positively impact patients’ lives. Ethics can be the difference between getting these medicines to patients quickly – or not at all.”
“At BMS, our employees understand the responsibility that comes with the role we play in patients’ lives and that we must ensure our values remain at the core of everything we do.”
Since joining BMS in 2003, Kim has supported multiple business units and therapeutic areas, including serving as Corporate Secretary. She led the legal support for Global Drug Development, led the law and compliance team for the U.S. market and co-led the global COVID-19 recovery team at BMS.
Kim began her career in private practice advising companies on FDA regulatory issues. She earned her bachelor of arts with distinction, a master’s degree in public health and her law degree with honors, all from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
An avid cyclist with a love of the outdoors, Kim is a multi-year participant and member of the management committee for the global C2C4C rides.
