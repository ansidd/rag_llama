Lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 (LPA1) in pulmonary fibrosis Fact sheet
While currently approved therapies can slow the decline in lung function caused by pulmonary fibrosis (PF), unmet needs remain. Fueled by our passion to help more patients, we are driven to tailor treatments to individual needs and help relieve the burdens of immune-mediated diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis.
Understanding pulmonary fibrosis
Pulmonary fibrosis (fibrosis occurring in the lungs) is a chronic, life-threatening interstitial lung disease (ILD) that is associated with worsening respiratory symptoms and reduced quality of life. 1,2
Fibrosis is defined by the overgrowth, hardening and/or scarring of various tissues. 1
It can occur in virtually any organ and results from inflammation that may be caused by a number of factors. 1,3
Pulmonary fibrosis occurs when lung tissue becomes damaged and scarred, reducing the lungs' ability to expand, collapse and, ultimately, function effectively. 4-6
The disease can lead to respiratory failure and death. 1,2
Understanding PF subtypes: PPF and IPF
Progressive pulmonary fibrosis (PPF) is the preferred term to describe patients that have ILD with a progressive fibrotic phenotype. 7
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the
most common type of progressive fibrosing ILD.
1
As an idiopathic disease, there is no identifiable cause.
Many people living with PPF and IPF are
physically impaired , experience a
progressive decline in lung function , have diffculty performing simple daily activities due to
breathlessness
and require
continuous supplemental oxygen
to ease the burden of normal breathing.
IPF is a fatal disease with a
median survival time of 3 to 5 years
following diagnosis and a
5-year survival rate of approximately 45% . Innovation in treatment has been limited with few new therapies approved in
nearly 10 years.
As a result, a significant need exists for new therapies. 8
LPA in pulmonary fibrosis
Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) promotes wound healing and collagen deposition.
Increased LPA levels and activation of LPA 1  have been implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. 9
A preclinical
in vitro
and
in vivo
study found that antagonizing—or blocking— LPA 1  receptors may have an impact in treating lung injury and fibrosis. 5
At Bristol Myers Squibb, we pursue
strategic research approaches
to address unmet needs for patients.
We understand how fibrosis plays a role in the development of several immune-mediated diseases and are applying this knowledge to develop new treatments that we hope may
address the underlying causes of disease.
