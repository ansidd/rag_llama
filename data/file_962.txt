Thabo Mwale TB Foundation
Thabo Mwale TB Foundation (TMTBF) is a charitable organization dedicated to the fight against tuberculosis (TB) and HIV.
Need
Thabo Mwale TB Foundation (TMTBF) is a patient-focused community-based organization that works with the business sector, employer organizations, and other non-governmental organizations to raise awareness about the spread of tuberculosis (TB).
They offer TB screening, HIV counseling (pre and post), health talks at clinics, schools, and churches, and door-to-door campaigns to encourage treatment adherence. TMTBF has a history of launching TB and HIV programs in Guateng, South Africa and with this grant, the organization will extend their services to four sub-districts of Madibeng.
Project
TMTBF will provide comprehensive TB services to the rural communities of Hebron, Mothutlung, Kgabalatsane, and Mmakau. The organization will survey the communities to find their level of knowledge, attitude, and practices involving HIV and TB and will then develop programs to raise awareness of both diseases. They will identify TB suspects at community screenings and refer them for diagnosis and treatment.
The Foundation’s Secure the Future initiative supports the TMTBF in monitoring and evaluation, conducting surveys to gain information in new areas, and improving their project and financial management.
