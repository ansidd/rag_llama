Psoriasis around the world
Psoriasis is a widely prevalent, chronic, systemic immune-mediated disease that impacts at least 100 million people worldwide. 1
Unfortunately, a lack of diverse education materials in medical training programs that detail how symptoms can present differently among individuals may lead to gaps in diagnosing and managing this disease.
The global community of individuals living with this autoimmune disease experiences significant disparities in the time and effort required to receive a definitive diagnosis and treatment. A need exists to better identify psoriasis in non-white skin types, as it presents differently in people of color. 2-8

How psoriasis is different for people of color
Psoriasis presents differently in skin of color, which can lead to misdiagnoses and being undiagnosed more frequently in people of color. Specifically, psoriasis is typically described as redness on lighter skin, but on skin of color, the discoloration can present as shades of purple, gray or dark brown, and the plaques can be thicker. 6

People living with psoriasis have an elevated risk of developing other serious conditions. More than 30% will ultimately develop psoriatic  arthritis, a chronic inflammatory disease that causes stiffness and pain in joints. Additionally, individuals with psoriasis have higher rates of cardiovascular disease, obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, sleep apnea, kidney disease and cancer, among others. 12
