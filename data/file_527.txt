Snapshot of Bristol Myers Squibb Ireland
December 03, 2017
While many choose to visit Dublin to seek out its rich history, in truth the city has become one of Europe’s most modern and thriving metropolitan areas known as a high-tech hub and hotbed of scientific innovation. Case in point, biopharma is booming in Ireland, with $8 billion invested in the sector in the country over the past decade alone, according to the Irish Times.
Bristol Myers Squibb Ireland’s newly constructed Cruiserath biologics plant is part of that growth trend. A 30,000-square meter state-of-the-art facility located thirty minutes outside of Dublin, the $1 billion dollar Cruiserath project is Bristol Myers Squibb’ first biologics plant located outside the United States.
Still undergoing the final phase of completion, the Cruiserath plant will employ approximately 440 scientists, engineers, bioprocess operators, quality specialists and other skilled workers once it is fully operational in late 2018. These employees will join some 200 people located nearby at the company’s external manufacturing facility in Dublin, and at the Bristol Myers Squibb distribution center in nearby Shannon.
