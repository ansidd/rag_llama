Early innovation at BMS
Our commitment to R&D innovation goes beyond internal drug discovery and our vast network of external partnerships. To accelerate the next wave of scientific breakthroughs, we also support life science startups and aspiring biotech entrepreneurs through a diverse and growing array of programs in the U.S. and abroad.
Bristol Myers Squibb sponsors three contests for Golden Tickets — with partner organizations in California, Massachusetts and New York. Each contest is administered and run separately according to each contest’s Official Rules.
Golden Ticket  contests also help startups advance their science and build their companies. Winning companies receive a year of fully-equipped and supported lab space through established incubator facilities based in some of Bristol Myers Squibb’s key regions for scientific research.
