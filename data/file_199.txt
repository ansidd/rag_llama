The tumor microenvironment (TME) refers to the complex network of cells and structures that surround a tumor and is comprised of many different cell types and molecules, typically including cancer cells, a wide variety of immune cells, stromal cells, blood vessels, extracellular matrix and regulatory proteins.
Cancer cells have mechanisms to evade or suppress the immune response within the TME, recruiting immune cells and using them to suppress the normal anti-cancer immune response, essentially making the cancer cells invisible to the human immune system and allowing cancer cells to grow without restraint.
Exploring the TME to better understand how cancer and the immune system coexist is a core component of Bristol Myers Squibb’s research and early development strategy. This understanding drives Bristol Myers Squibb toward a goal of discovering and clinically validating novel therapies and therapeutic combinations that are informed by the complex biology of the TME, setting new standards for patient outcomes.
