Stakeholder engagement
At Bristol Myers Squibb, stakeholder engagement is an integral part of our efforts to achieve our Mission. We recognize that discovery, development and delivery of innovative medicines to address unmet medical needs are improved by partnership and understanding of stakeholder needs and expectations. Our stakeholders include patients and the broader healthcare community, our employees, business associates, government, non-governmental organizations, investors and communities.
Engagement with our stakeholders provides opportunity for greater understanding of emerging issues, trends and expectations, fosters increased trust and support, and provides synergies. Addressing stakeholder expectations and emerging issues as part of business strategy facilitates the sustainability and success of our company.
The stakeholders with whom we actively engage are identified based on factors such as:
their ability to help us better define areas of unmet medical need, particularly in our disease areas of focus,
their relative importance to our business operations,
the knowledge and insight they can bring to the discussion,
the benefits of enhanced interaction and
the opportunity for critical and informed feedback.
We also have systems in place to allow all stakeholders to communicate with us regarding specific issues or concerns. For example, we engage with patients and healthcare providers seeking information on our products; we engage with multi-lateral organizations, investors and analysts seeking information about the company’s financial performance, business strategy or governance programs, and we engage with communities furthering collaboration/support.
Engagement with our employees plays an important role in the conduct of our business, and is conducted across numerous venues. Communications from the top down, from the bottom up and across functional areas, are facilitated, including through the following types of initiatives:
Functional and cross-functional committees,
State-of-the-business addresses and written communications

We engage with patient and professional advocacy organizations regarding patient access issues on a regular basis in disease areas in which it is engaged (virology, oncology, mental illness, etc.).

These meetings with stakeholders are undertaken in a variety of forums. These forums range from formal meetings focused on specific disease areas, bringing together patient advocates, medical providers, scientists, and policy experts, to more informal meetings meant to share information or to provide an educational briefing to government entities and/or patient advocacy or community groups.
