Supplier diversity
Connect. Engage. Innovate. Doing work that matters is our passion. So is creating an environment that celebrates diversity. A culture based on fairness and respect doesn't stop with our employees, it extends to our suppliers. We’re committed to working with suppliers that represent the diversity of our employees and the communities where we live and work.
