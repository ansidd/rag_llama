Accelerating access to care
Bristol Myers Squibb is committed to Access Accelerated, a new global initiative launched at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland on January 18, 2017 to help advance access to treatment and care for patients with non-communicable diseases, or NCDs, in underserved countries.

Working with the World Bank and the Union for International Cancer Control, Bristol Myers Squibb is one of 22 biopharmaceutical companies involved in the collaboration.
“Our focus on patients is unwavering,” said Bristol Myers Squibb CEO Giovanni Caforio, M.D. “Working together with multilateral organizations and our partners in the pharmaceutical industry, we aim to improve the prevention, care and treatment of non-communicable diseases like cancer through innovative medicines.”

Access Accelerated
is committed to helping achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, and in particular, the target to reduce premature deaths from NCDs by one-third by 2030. NCDs, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes and mental health disorders are the leading causes of death and disability worldwide.
The goals of Access Accelerated align with the work the Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation continues to do in communities throughout the world to promote health equity and improve the health outcomes of populations disproportionately affected by serious diseases and conditions.
