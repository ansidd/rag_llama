Meet John
John has always cared deeply about helping people. After earning a degree in psychology, he started in social work so he could make a difference in as many lives as possible.
His leadership of the Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation aligns with his personal and professional mission to help improve health equity and outcomes for populations disproportionately affected by serious diseases: HIV in Africa, hepatitis in Asia and cancer in the United States.
He is driven by Bristol Myers Squibb’s commitment to help develop medical infrastructure and train healthcare professionals in areas of significant unmet need.
“
I think back to the hundreds of thousands of lives we've been able to impact...because we work for a company that really cares about the whole patient, not just the medicine.
