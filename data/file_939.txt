Rosalynn Carter Institute for Caregiving
For veterans suffering from severe injuries, the transition home can be quite jarring - for them and their caregivers. We’re committed to working with organizations that have made it their mission to provide care to those in need.
Need
Since 9/11, more than 50,000 men and women deployed for military service have been wounded in action. Many caregivers are hesitant to seek help, especially outside of their military comfort zone. The
Rosalynn Carter Institute for Caregiving
(RCI) establishes local, state, national, and international partnerships committed to building quality, long-term, home and community-based services.
Project
Operation Family Caregiver, a support program of the Rosalynn Carter Institute for Caregiving, provides support through in-home visits and coaching customized according to each family’s needs. The
Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation
provided RCI a $600,000 grant to pilot a 100-percent volunteer version of the support program.
Volunteers come from
Blue Star Families , a national veterans service organization made up of active and veteran military personnel from the National Guard, the Reserves or family members of those who have served.
