Defamatory or libelous

Inappropriate (profanity or vulgarity)
Promoting illegal activity
Containing unsupported accusations or material from unverified sources
An infringement on copyrights or trademarks
Spam or promotional links

We observe industry best practices online
We reserve the right to remove mentions of any Bristol Myers Squibb medicine or other pharmaceutical company’s medicine.
We cannot address any medications or medical treatments by Bristol Myers Squibb or another pharmaceutical company. Nothing we post should be viewed as medical advice.
If you’re a patient who may have experienced an adverse event or think you may be experiencing an adverse event from one of our medications, please report any side effects by calling us at 1-800-721-5072 (toll free U.S. only). Any side effects mentioned will be addressed according to FDA regulations. Potential side effects of prescription drugs can and should be reported to the FDA. Visit

If your public comment or post references a side effect for one of our medications, we may contact you privately.
We do not take responsibility for the comments that you post. Please do not post any personal or confidential information about yourself, patients or anyone else on our channels. Keep in mind mentioning your relationship to someone (e.g., “my sister”) can possibly identify them.
If you post a comment or question, we’ll try our best to respond, but we reserve the right not to. Our response should not be taken as an endorsement of a comment.
