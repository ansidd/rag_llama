The Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation holds their fourth annual Joint Grantee Summit for its Bridging Cancer Care and Specialty Care for Vulnerable Populations initiatives. This year, the theme of the Summit is “Making a Difference in Health Equity: Visions – Actions – Impacts from the Frontlines” reflecting the transformative nature of grantee projects to meet the treatment, care and support needs of vulnerable and medically underserved populations facing cancer, cardiovascular disease, and disaster preparedness and relief. The expert keynotes and capacity building workshops will also provide opportunities for you to view your work in the larger context of health equity as well as learn from successful models and tools for patient segmentation data, sustainability plan development, trauma informed care, and telehealth & care collaboration.
