MARCH 18, 2021
We are devastated by the sharp increase in hate and discrimination directed against the Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) community in the U.S. over the last year. The perceptions and stereotypes of Asian and Asian Americans have led to an increase in violent acts and trace back centuries. The incidents that occurred in the United States serve as yet another disturbing example of the violence frequently faced by the AAPI community, many of whom are experiencing greatly heightened levels of anxiety and fear.
To our Asian colleagues, partners, and allies - we stand with you.
Bristol Myers Squibb condemns violence of any kind – it goes against our core values of integrity and inclusion in the service of patients. We take seriously our continued responsibility to foster an inclusive environment in which our workforce feels safe, heard and valued.
Each and every one of us has a role to play in combatting any form of racial violence, discrimination and prejudice, and we look forward to working alongside you.
