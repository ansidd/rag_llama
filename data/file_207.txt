Toll-like receptors (TLR) 7 and 8 fact sheet
About TLR 7/8
A healthy immune response to pathogens  plays a key role in protection from infection.
Toll-like receptors (TLR) 7 and 8 help detect the presence of certain pathogens in the body and help initiate and amplify both innate (nonspecific) and adaptive (specialized or specific) immune responses. 1,2
These receptors in immune cells normally recognize single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) from pathogens (such as certain viruses) and activate various immune cells, resulting in  an immune response. 1,2
TLR 7/8 and Inflammatory Diseases
An
uncontrolled or
misdirected immune
response
by the body
can contribute to the
damage of otherwise
healthy cells, resulting in
immune-mediated
diseases.
Overactivation of
TLR7/8
contributesto
inflammation that occurs
in immune-mediated
diseases. 1,3
TLR7/8 can become
overstimulated when
the receptors recognize
and are
activated by
ssRNA released by
damaged tissue . 1,3
Certain immune-mediated diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus,  are associated with
defects in the body’s ability to eliminate cell debris  from tissue damage , which can activate TLR7/8 and further contribute to  the disease. 4
TLR7 gain-of-function genetic variations may also be a driver for systemic  lupus erythematosus. 5
Research Implications
Researchers are investigating potential ways to prevent the activation of the TLR7/8 pathway by blocking the receptors with small molecule inhibitors. 6,7
This inhibition may help in the treatment of a range of immune-mediated diseases, such as  lupus and other rheumatic diseases. 7
At Bristol Myers Squibb, our investigation of immune pathways and receptors like TLR7/8 helps to deepen our understanding of disease and causal human biology and further our efforts to deliver meaningful solutions to patients with immune-mediated diseases.
