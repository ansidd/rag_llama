University of Michigan’s Military Support Programs and Networks (M-SPAN)
University of Michigan’s Military Support Programs and Networks (M-SPAN) will receive $585,198 over three years to develop, implement and evaluate After Her Service, an evidence-based resiliency pilot program tailored for post 9-11 women veterans.
Need
Females make up more than 18% of the post-9-11 veteran population, the highest percentage of women veterans in American history. Compared with their male peers, women veterans of the post-9-11 era tend to be younger, more diverse, and more likely to face financial struggles and unemployment. Women veterans also face unique barriers to treatment that may compound these challenges.
Project
The University of Michigan’s Military Support Programs and Networks (M-SPAN) in partnership with The Mission Continues will pilot an evidence-based resiliency program tailored for post 9-11 women veterans offered in a retreat format, combined with follow-up services that include a coaching intervention and ongoing social media support.
