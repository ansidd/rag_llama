Soldiers often return home carrying more than duffle bags and dog tags. An estimated 300,000 veterans suffer from excessive alcohol consumption and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which prevents successful reintegration with family and community. We're on a mission to change that.
Need
For hundreds of thousands of veterans, alcoholism and PTSD are major obstacles standing in the way of leading fulfilling and productive lives. As the country continues to demobilizing its overseas forces, the number of combat veterans returning home in need of support is expected to grow substantially. Federal budget cuts, a lack of counseling resources in many local areas, and access to services based on geographical limitations will leave a number of those in need with nowhere to turn.
Project
A grant from the  Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation  made it possible to expand  VetChange , a free self-directed, web-based intervention program created by the Trustees of Boston University. This program is designed to help veterans better manage their drinking and PTSD.
The user-friendly interactive program allows veterans to set weekly goals, track their drinking reduction process and PTSD symptoms over time, and get additional help from trained peer volunteers and professional counselors.
