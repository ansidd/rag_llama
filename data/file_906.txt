The Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation
Our focus area
Improving Specialty Immunology Care
Under-resourced communities and people of color are disproportionately impacted by immunological disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and are less likely to receive high-quality care. Among the Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation’s goals is to improve the delivery and utilization of specialty immunology care and to support programs that improve self-management, education and quality of life.
Immunology disparities
African Americans who suffer from multiple sclerosis can experience more disability compared to white people.
Only 1% of literature about multiple sclerosis focuses on minority populations, despite research indicating that incidence rates may be higher for African Americans than white Americans.
