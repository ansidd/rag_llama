“If you are looking for a place where camaraderie matters, it’s here.” ~
Yusuf Oni, Associate Scientific Director, Sterile Product Development
What I do –
As an Associate Scientific Director of Sterile Product   Development I’m responsible for the evaluation, design and development of delivery technologies and solutions (such as vials and prefillable syringes) for our parenteral products. I also co-lead the BOLD STEM team where we are invested in fostering the pipeline for Black talent in the STEM fields internally and externally; and across all levels (K-5 to graduate levels). We achieve this through teaching, mentorship, scholarship awards etc. in many forums.
What makes Bristol Myers Squibb a great place to work?
The people. The culture. I can only work for a place that feels like home away from home, and Bristol Myers Squibb feels that way to me. As a cancer survivor, I understood the importance of having medicines for serious diseases and as an engineer, I recognize the significance of designing patient-centric products. I’m incredibly proud of touching the design of many products that reach a patient or caregiver’s hands.
What would you say to someone thinking about working here?
A funny story. When I was called to come in for my interview, I hesitantly agreed. I already had another job offer that I was about to accept. I promptly told my friend who had referred me that I was only going as a professional courtesy and would not accept an offer if it was made. A few hours later post-interview, I called the same friend and said that this is the offer I would accept if I got the job!
Our values will appeal to you. If you are looking for a place where camaraderie matters, it’s here. A place where we believe that the “priceless ingredient of every product is the honor and integrity of its maker.” And these values always shine through the people. Just like on my interview day.

“Knowing that in some small way I can contribute to someone’s story of healing and hope is an amazing feeling.” ~
Kimberly Gray, Associate Director, Integrated Scientific Operations Translational Medicine
What I do –  As a Translational Medicine Program Manager, I use my communication and organizational skills to hold my team accountable for timely delivery of biomarker data for key clinical RCC and Melanoma studies. I came to Bristol Myers Squibb with many years of experience in early drug discovery, specializing in assay development. I am grateful for the opportunity here to pivot from the laboratory to an operational role in which I can leverage my scientific expertise alongside my passion for collaboration and communication. I also enjoy my volunteer work as a co-lead on the BOLD Black History Month Professional Development team. Being a part of BOLD has given me an opportunity to build relationships with my colleagues while learning about the business of pharma.
What makes Bristol Myers Squibb a great place to work?
Bristol Myers Squibb is a great place to work because it is purposeful in creating a culture where we can all be proud of who we are individually and how we contribute to the mission of our company. Bristol Myers Squibb constantly looks for ways to be a better company and deliver the next quality product more efficiently. Here we work for the patient. It is always exciting to hear stories about patients who have benefited from one of our products. Knowing that in some small way I can contribute to someone’s story of healing and hope is an amazing feeling.
