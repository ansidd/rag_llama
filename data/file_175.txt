Inflammatory Bowel Disease Global Assessment of Patient and Physician Unmet Needs Survey (IBD GAPPS)  is a global survey initiative seeking to uncover emerging and under-recognized unmet needs for clinicians, patients and the wider community of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) stakeholders. Bristol Myers Squibb developed and fielded the survey in 2019 to understand the impact of the evolving IBD treatment landscape on the needs of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD) and their healthcare providers. The survey questions and findings were validated by a multinational Steering Committee of 9 IBD experts, advocacy partners and patients.
More than 2,300 adult patients with IBD and over 650 gastroenterologists from the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom completed the survey, which was one of the largest surveys of its kind. To learn more about the population surveyed and the key survey findings, please see the IBD GAPPS overview infographic and
press release .
The IBD GAPPS initiative reveals the critical need for improved communication and education for patients and physicians, as well as treatment options that provide durable disease control. Addressing the key areas of disconnect identified in this survey may have a positive impact on HCP/patient communication and may help address current gaps in treatment. By gathering insights into patient and prescriber perceptions of unmet needs, the IBD GAPPS initiative helps the IBD community take an important step forward in treating IBD.
