The Association of Community Cancer Centers received a grant of $4.27 million for a three year project to develop the Optimal Care Coordination Model, to improve the access and quality of care provided to Medicaid patients with lung cancer treated in community oncology practices.
Need
Lung cancer represents approximately 13% of all new cancers in the United States, yet it is the leading cause of cancer deaths in both men and women. 37% of Medicaid-covered patients are smokers, which is double the national rate, and community oncologists are estimated to treat over 75% of lung cancer patients in the U.S.
With increasing research and guideline developments, community oncologists are able to translate their clinical knowledge into implementing best practices for patients, including Medicaid patients.
Project
The ACCC, with other key partners, will develop the Optimal Care Coordination Model (OCCM). The OCCM will be a comprehensive written plan to guide community oncology practices and improve the provision of diagnosis, treatment, and management of lung cancer care services to Medicaid patients.
The aim will be to understand current care and how to strengthen care coordination between patients, healthcare providers, and systems. Five ACCC member sites will launch and evaluate the OCCM before distributing the models and tools to other ACCC members and the broader cancer care community.
