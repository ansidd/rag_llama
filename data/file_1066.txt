Support for European patient organizations
As part of our mission to discover, develop and deliver innovative medicines that help patients prevail over serious diseases, Bristol Myers Squibb and the Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation support patient organizations across Europe through partnerships, grants and charitable contributions. We provided financial and non-financial support of medical, scientific, educational, and healthcare-related initiatives to these European patient organizations in our specified disease areas.
