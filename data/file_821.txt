Our Journey Ahead/EEO-1 Data
At Bristol Myers Squibb, our mission is to discover, develop and deliver innovative medicines to help patients prevail over serious diseases.
This requires working to ensure that those who need our medicines have access to them, especially vulnerable populations disproportionately affected by serious diseases.
As an organization motivated to work smarter, faster and better, our scientific advances allow us to redefine the future of personalized medicine and make life-changing care accessible to those who need it.
We believe it is not simply about giving patients longer life—it is also about offering the possibility of a better life.
Our ability to treat more patients, however, relies directly on an even deeper understanding of who they are, the unique challenges they face and their trust in our science.
We believe the only way we can successfully work toward this is by building a workforce whose diverse experiences, perspectives and personal backgrounds reflect the diversity of our global patient population.
Our continuing journey
For Bristol Myers Squibb, global diversity and inclusion (GD&I) is an evolving journey. We can take pride in our advancements over the years, and we match that pride with an accountability to accelerate our efforts where needed to close critical gaps—for our employees and our patients.
This report is about our 30,000+ employees and reflects the diverse experiences they contribute to our commitment to our patients and communities.
