The Foundation’s
Mental Health & Well-Being
initiative aims to help veterans, military service members, their families, and the families of the fallen. We focus on community-based solutions to help with mental health and community reintegration.
The Foundation is also a founding member of the
Philanthropy-Joining Forces Impact Pledge
in collaboration with the Office of the First Lady. Together, we work with corporate professionals to create one-on-one mentoring relationships for veterans.
