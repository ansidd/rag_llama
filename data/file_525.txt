Snapshot of Bristol Myers Squibb Japan
November 08, 2017
Though a small country, with an area just slightly smaller than the state of California, Japan’s role in the international community is significant, as the third largest contributor to the world economy.
Employees at Bristol Myers Squibb’s Tokyo office
At Bristol Myers Squibb, the Japanese business is also as significant.
The company’s head office is located in Tokyo, the most populated metropolitan area in the world. Six hundred of Bristol Myers Squibb Japan’s approximately 1500 employees work in the Tokyo office, located in the Nishi-Shinjuku business district, an area known for its numerous skyscrapers. The company also has a manufacturing facility in Aichi, located 160 miles from Tokyo, and 42 sales offices located nationwide.
People and “Ikuboss”
In March 2017 Bristol Myers Squibb Japan joined the “Ikuboss Alliance," a network of Japanese companies that recognize the need to cultivate a new management style promoting a diverse workforce and a healthy balance between work and family commitments.
“Conventional approaches to management have traditionally been an obstacle to work-life balance, and this has the potential to hurt the company’s growth and competitiveness,” said Fusayoshi Tajima, head of Human Resources for Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. “Learning more about ikuboss has certainly opened my eyes to how I can manage and engage with my team more effectively.”
Teams at Bristol Myers Squibb Japan will hold ikuboss awareness workshops to help managers understand how to drive high performing teams while also proactively supporting career development and work-life balance.
