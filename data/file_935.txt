Thanks to the Post-9/11 GI Bill, college campuses are seeing a large influx of student veterans. We’re committed to making sure these students have the tools needs for academic and personal success.
Need
Having someone that understands the needs of student veterans transitioning from military to campus life is invaluable. Unfortunately, many universities and colleges don't currently have a system in place to provide student veterans the support they need.
Project
In 2012, the  Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation  funded  Peer Advisors for Veterans Education  (P.A.V.E.) at 10 participating college campuses. A peer-to-peer program, P.A.V.E. connects incoming student veterans with student veterans already on campus. The University of Michigan developed the mobile/web-based platform and spearheaded the national roll out. A mobile app gives student veterans instant access to program materials and other resources appropriate for their needs.
The program added 30 new P.A.V.E. campuses. Expanding the reach and impact of this valuable resource to a total of 42  partnering schools  throughout the country.
