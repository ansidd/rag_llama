Radiopharmaceutical therapy, or RPT, is emerging as a potential next wave in cancer treatment. Offering a precision approach to patient care, RPT allows physicians to deliver radioisotopes in a highly targeted way directly to tumors. The radioisotopes can be used either as a useful diagnostic tool, to help image the precise location of the tumors, or to kill cancer cells.
Through the acquisition of RayzeBio, Bristol Myers Squibb has taken an innovation-leading position in the development of RPTs. With several potential first or best-in-class programs, RayzeBio is at the forefront of pioneering the application of RPTs. RayzeBio is investigating several potential new RPT medicines which would use an actinium-225 radioisotope, and have the potential to be effective in several different types of cancer, including gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs), small cell lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and other cancers. The addition of RayzeBio broadens the Bristol Myers Squibb oncology platform and establishes our presence in one of the most promising new modalities for the treatment of solid tumors.
