Meet Tim
Tim received his diagnosis the same year his hometown team went to the World Series. Seeing them beat the odds as an underdog inspired him in his cancer battle. Tim is grateful for the time he now has following a treatment option from Bristol Myers Squibb.  He maintains his positive attitude and is thankful for all the support he received.
