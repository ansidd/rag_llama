Global position statement on supply chain
BMS believes that diverse, global supply chains are essential to preventing interruptions in the manufacturing of medicines. BMS believes that it is essential for manufacturers to maintain autonomy and flexibility in crafting supply chains in order to better respond to supply chain issues resulting from pandemics or other emergencies.
In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, policymakers have voiced concerns regarding pharmaceutical manufacturing supply chains and their reliance on other countries for limited or single sourcing ingredients, leading to a push for localization/reshoring of manufacturing.
BMS cautions against measures that restrict manufacturing and supply of medicines as they can disrupt distribution channels, delay clinical trials, increase the risk of drug shortages, and potentially have a negative impact on patient outcomes. BMS believes that any new measures enacted should advance appropriate incentives for supply chain changes, and not be punitive in nature.
