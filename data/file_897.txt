West Virginia University Cancer Institute
Need
West Virginia has one of the highest incidence rates of lung and bronchus cancer in the United States (81.2 per 100,000 vs. 62.4 per 100,000), accounting for over 18% of cancers diagnosed in the state each year. In 2014, the West Virginia University Cancer Institute (WVUCI) diagnosed 588 new cases of lung cancer.   Further, lung cancer is by far the leading cause of cancer-related death in West Virginia, accounting for more than 30% of all cancer deaths, claiming more lives than prostate, breast and colon cancer combined.  About 1 in 8 West Virginia adults are cancer survivors (13.0%) which ranks West Virginia the 10th highest for overall cancer prevalence and the state has significantly lower lung cancer survival rates than the nation (16.9 compared to 20.0).
Project
West Virginia University Cancer Institute (WVUCI) will implement "Bridge to Good Living: Thriving beyond Lung Cancer" in four primary cancer facilities affiliated with the university: the Mary Babb Randolph Cancer Center; The United Health Center; Berkeley Medical Center; and Camden Clark Medical Center. The target population for this project is residents of Appalachia who reside in predominantly rural or small cities/towns in West Virginia and receive their medical care from WVUCI.
"Bridge to Good Living" will provide survivorship care to approximately 411 lung cancer survivors with stage 1-3 lung cancer. The project will demonstrate the need to extend a team-based model and carry resources beyond adjuvant treatment to better meet the needs of lung cancer survivors, their family members and others affected by the disease with a goal of improving overall coordination of care, quality of life, and decrease the consequences of treatment for patients diagnosed with lung cancer in West Virginia.
