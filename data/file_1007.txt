Inno Community Development Organisation
The Inno Community Development Organization will develop and implement a program that will raise awareness about hepatitis C virus (HCV) and establish 10 HCV intervention centers to help prevent and control spread of the disease.
Need
In 2013, the population of migrant workers in China, who are at high-risk for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, reached a peak of 269 million. 83.5% had limited training in hepatitis and healthcare access and 16.5% had no training in those areas.
Inno applied information it had gathered about hepatitis B virus (HBV) prevention programs supported by the Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation’s
Delivering Hope
initiative. They concluded that engaging stakeholders and implementing community-based training would help communities respond to hepatitis, especially among vulnerable groups such as migrant workers and mobile individuals.
Project
Inno Community Development Organization will receive $332,913 over two years to develop and implement a program for the migrant and mobile populations in Guangzhou, China.
Inno will work with community partners to:
​Establish 10 community-based HCV Intervention Centers that will focus on improving self-screening and protection against HBV and HCV infections
Train community-based social and welfare organizations to add HBV and HCV support services to those provided for target beneficiaries
Set up a community hotline and Wechat – mobile text messaging - accounts to disseminate information and generate feedback about the program
About 10,000 mobile people and 20,000 family members are expected to directly benefit from the effort.
