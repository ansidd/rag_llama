University of California Davis and HALO Clinic
University of California Davis, in a collaborative partnership with the Health and Life Organization will prospectively identify and follow Asian American patients across the cancer continuum to improve cancer prevention and control behaviors for lung, liver, GI and colorectal, cervical, and breast cancer and to create a New Patient Referral service between a FQHC-lookalike and NCI Comprehensive Cancer Center.
Need
Asian Americans comprise 17.6% of Sacramento County, CA and the HALO clinic serves approximately 8,800 AANHPI patients. The largest patient population in the HALO clinic is the Hmong population who face higher unemployment, lower per capita income, and have the lowest survival rates for liver cancer. Cancers that disproportionately affect AANHPIs are unique due in their infectious origins such as cervical cancer (HPV), stomach/GI cancer ( Helicobacter pylori ), or liver cancer (hepatitis B).
Project
The goal of the University of California Davis and HALO clinic (the “Collaborative”) is to develop a successful, sustainable and scalable model of enhanced specialty care in cancer detection, treatment, control, and prevention for Asian Americans in Sacramento County, CA. This model will focus on connecting and moving patients through the cancer continuum utilizing a team-based approach and improve skills and cultural competency for providers, clinic staff, and patients. The Collaborative will prospectively identify and manage HALO patients to recommend cancer prevention and control behaviors, improve patient and provider interactions, and ensure better coordination of cancer care through UCD Cancer Center’s New Patient Referral Service.
