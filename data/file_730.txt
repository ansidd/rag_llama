Meet Gary
Gary was busy celebrating many wonderful milestones with his family when he was diagnosed with cancer. After realizing he didn’t have a lot of time, his doctor recommended a clinical trial from Bristol Myers Squibb. Today, Gary has the deepest gratitude for the huge difference it made in his life and his family’s life.
