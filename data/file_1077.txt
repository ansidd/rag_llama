Key takeaway messages
BMS believes that the health of people is inextricably linked to the health of the planet, and BMS remains committed to improving environmental health globally.
Our commitment to environmental sustainability is one of the foundational elements of our corporate culture and central to who we are.
At BMS, we recognize the impact our operations can have on the environment, and we're committed to minimizing that impact. We're continually looking for ways to reduce our carbon footprint, conserve resources and promote sustainable practices across our business. From reducing waste and energy consumption to sourcing materials responsibly, we're working to make a positive impact.
BMS recognizes the key roles that environmental factors and climate change play in public health and patient outcomes and is committed to doing our part in addressing environmental risks. We also recognize that to promote health equity, public policies need to recognize the role of environmental factors as key social determinants of health.
Our commitment to environmental responsibility extends to our broader commitment around transparency and reporting of our environmental and climate policies, initiatives, progress, and disclosure through our Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Report, Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) Report, and Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) Report.
