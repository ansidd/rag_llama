Global position statement on antimicrobial resistance (AMR)
Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is a natural process that occurs when microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites develop the ability to survive against the drugs designed to kill them. That means the resistant germs can continue to grow and spread to other people, animals and plants. This has a broader implication for many settings, including hospitals, communities, livestock and food supplies.
The global impact of AMR poses an increasingly serious threat to human health around the world. AMR is directly associated with at least 1.27 million deaths per year, making AMR a leading cause of death globally, higher than HIV/AIDS and malaria. 1

BMS supports AMR efforts through work with associations like IFPMA, EFPIA, and PhRMA, and other key stakeholders globally. BMS is also committed to supporting legislation in support AMR efforts globally, particularly those efforts that support access to medicines for patients.
