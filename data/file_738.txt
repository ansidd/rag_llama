When Matt Labrecque first experienced the tingling sensation in his thigh, it felt almost like his leg was falling asleep. This tingling sensation was different though. He saw a neurologist, who confirmed a diagnosis—Matt had relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). Matt is proud to be a research scientist at Bristol Myers Squibb seeking new treatment options for other diseases while at the same time being part of a patient community.
