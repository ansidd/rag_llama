Ralph Lauren Center for Cancer Care and Prevention
Ralph Lauren Center for Cancer Care and Prevention (RLC) is a New York State Article 28 Certified Diagnostic and Treatment Center. RLC has provided cancer diagnosis, prevention and treatment services that address the unique needs of underserved individuals in a community setting in Harlem.
Need
Death rates from lung cancer are highest among African Americans. They are often diagnosed at advanced stages of the disease, have delays in wait times to receive treatment, and are less likely to receive surgical treatment options.
Project
Ralph Lauren Center for Cancer Care and Prevention (RLC) will partner with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) to develop a new model for lung cancer screening and treatment.
The program will test new approaches, including community and public outreach. RLC outreach navigators will visit community centers, houses of worship, and gathering places in East Harlem and other areas of high need in New York City. These navigators will provide education on risk reduction, the need for screening, and availability of services. RLC navigators will also visit primary and family health centers to meet with patients in waiting rooms and coordinate their care.
A kiosk will be installed in the waiting room at the Center’s East Harlem facility where patients can access literature about smoking cessation and other preventive measures. Patients diagnosed with lung cancer will be navigated to care at RLC or MSK.
