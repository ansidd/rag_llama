Science
It is estimated that more than 12 million people worldwide live with one of the two most common inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) –  ulcerative colitis (UC)  or  Crohn’s disease . 1  IBD is an immune-mediated disease in which the delicate balance of the gut is disrupted, leading to swelling or inflammation of the intestines. This inflammation often results in permanent damage, and impacts everyday life during flare-ups. 2,4
The Impact of living with inflammatory bowel disease
People living with UC and Crohn’s disease must deal with both the physical and emotional toll of their disease, which can include:
pain, fatigue and discomfort 5,6
stress and anxiety tied to the uncertain nature of IBD, including the timing of flares or ability to locate a restroom  4,7
interference with work 6
perceived stigma surrounding bowel-related symptoms
social isolation
poor body image
Unfortunately, for some patients, current medications are unable to control their inflammation, leaving them with no option but to have a large section of their intestine removed surgically. 4,8
Current options for patients leave many struggling to control their condition
For people living with UC and Crohn’s disease, responding to therapy and achieving remission are critical treatment goals. Response to treatment, which is measured by symptom relief, and clinical remission, which is usually defined as very limited clinical disease activity, typically accompanies a reduction in the inflammation of the gut. Current therapies include anti-inflammatories to manage mild symptoms, and for more severe disease, therapies may include steroids, small molecules, immunomodulators or biologics in the form of injectables.
While these therapies prove effective for some people, many living with IBD do not obtain lasting relief. Patients often experience high relapse rates with some only having short-term symptom relief, leaving them struggling to control their condition. 9,4
Many patients are unable to achieve optimal disease control and some have no response to treatment at all. 2,15
Bristol Myers Squibb is focused on advancing care for patients
At Bristol Myers Squibb, we are committed to developing transformational therapies that meet the needs of patients living with IBD. Our researchers follow the science to pursue novel targets and innovative approaches that may lead to new therapeutic options as well as disease prevention strategies. As we conduct clinical trials, we have an opportunity to deepen our understanding of IBD and analyze critical data that may offer new insights that advance research and, ultimately, care for patients.
As part of our efforts, we developed and fielded the
Inflammatory Bowel Disease Global Assessment of Patients and Physician Unmet Needs Survey (IBD GAPPS)
in 2019 to better understand the impact of the evolving IBD treatment landscape on the needs of patients with both UC and Crohn’s disease, as well as their doctors. Through talking with more than 2,300 patients and more than 650 gastroenterologists around the world, we gathered critical insights into patient and prescriber perceptions of unmet needs, aiming to help the IBD community take an important step forward in treating IBD. 16
With our focus on transforming care for patients, we are continuing to work towards developing therapies that will lead to lasting remission for those living with immune-mediated diseases.
