How We Are Helping People Living with HIV in Africa
Since 1999, the Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation has made a positive and lasting difference in the lives of more than 1 million women and children living with HIV through its support of more than 250 projects in 22 countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
Several factors have helped transform HIV and AIDS from an acute health crisis to a manageable chronic disease in some countries, including disease awareness and education, expanded treatments and improvements in healthcare system capacity. However, people living with HIV in Africa are now dying from diseases such as tuberculosis (TB) and cervical cancer at greater rates.
Building on the legacy of its groundbreaking work in HIV/AIDS, the Foundation’s  SECURE THE FUTURE  initiative is now demonstrating the positive impact that communities can have on preventing the transmission of TB and reducing deaths from cervical and breast cancers by leveraging the HIV experience and infrastructure especially among women.
