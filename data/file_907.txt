Diversity in clinical trials
Developing community-oriented clinical trialists
The Robert A. Winn Diversity in Clinical Trials Award program, created by the Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation, develops clinical investigators who are racially and ethnically diverse or who are committed to increasing diversity in clinical trials, and exposes promising, underrepresented minority medical students to clinical research career pathways.
The Winn Award program is training world-class clinical research scientists with additional knowledge, skills and competencies in effective community outreach and engagement. This new generation of physician investigators has the potential to transform the clinical research landscape by conducting clinical trials designed with the goal of increasing the diversity of their participants.

“Through my participation in the program, I hope to ultimately improve patient diversity and outcomes for all globally. People should be aware that doctors want to cover the entire population in clinical trials. It is not one group that we specifically care about, but rather the whole community.”

“Every clinical trial involves the unknown. Therefore, the currency for clinical trials is trust. Patients have to be able to trust that the researchers have their best interests in mind and are being transparent about what they are doing. And fostering that type of trust requires a real connection.”
