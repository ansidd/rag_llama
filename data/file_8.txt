Update to voluntary recall of Eliquis® (apixaban) 5 mg tablets (#HN0063)
Recall to retail/dispensing level only
On June 10, Bristol Myers Squibb announced a voluntary recall of one lot (#HN0063) of  Eliquis
5 mg tablets. This lot was distributed nationwide in the U.S. to wholesalers and retail pharmacies in February 2017. Bristol Myers Squibb is taking this precautionary measure based on a single customer complaint that a bottle labeled as Eliquis
5 mg was found to contain Eliquis 2.5 mg tablets. No other lots are impacted by this recall.
This recall is to the
retail/dispensing level
and
not
to the consumer level. This recall is under way and is currently being executed. The recall is being conducted with the knowledge of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
Patients should
not stop taking Eliquis
without consulting with their physician .
