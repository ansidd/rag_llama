Our research in immunology
At Bristol Myers Squibb, we are working to deliver meaningful solutions that address unmet needs in dermatology, gastroenterology, pulmonology and rheumatology. We have spent the last two decades pioneering new treatments and continually innovating to modulate the body’s immune response to treat disease. We strive to deliver truly transformational science at an accelerated speed — making durable remissions and cures a reality for more patients faster than ever.

Our sequential immunotherapy framework
As proven pioneers in modulating the body’s immune response, Bristol Myers Squibb continues to pursue pathbreaking science by pushing the boundaries in immune-mediated diseases. Our sequential immunotherapy framework aims to address the root cause of disease by controlling inflammation, resetting the immune system and maintaining the renewed homeostasis – a balancing act akin to leveling out a tipping scale – fueled by a passion to deliver transformational benefits for patients in need.

Dermatology at BMS
Through our pioneering exploration of immune pathways implicated in dermatologic conditions, our discovery team’s research is leading to the potential for safe, effective, category-defining new therapies that may address the pressing treatment gaps that continue to exist for people living with these conditions. With a highly focused pipeline, we are pursuing novel treatments for psoriasis and exploring a broad range of serious dermatologic conditions in our early research.

Gastroenterology at BMS
We are pursuing innovative research to potentially change the course of gastrointestinal immune-mediated diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). Our scientific innovations have the potential to provide relief and remission to people living with these conditions.

Rheumatology at BMS
Over 20 years ago, we pioneered the science of modulating the body’s immune response to treat disease, beginning with our research in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Building on that foundation, we continue to pursue pathbreaking science across rheumatic diseases including RA, psoriatic arthritis, lupus and Sjögren’s disease. Fueled by the possibility to help more patients, we are following the science to tailor therapies to individual needs, improve outcomes and expand treatment options.
