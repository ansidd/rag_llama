Working Together For Patients
Discovery is in Nils’ DNA. His fascination with chemistry labs began as child, when he tagged along with his father, who was a graduate student at the University of California. As a graduate student at Harvard, Nils learned about a new technology for manipulating the genome of mammals, and was so intrigued that he continued this field of study in a postdoctoral fellowship at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York.
Today, at Bristol Myers Squibb, Nils leads a drug discovery group responsible for looking for new medicines to help patients overcome serious diseases. He continues to follow his passion: working with a team of dedicated scientists on research that has the potential to change the way cancer is treated.

I think this is an historic time for cancer research. I'm very lucky to be able to witness this particular historic time.
