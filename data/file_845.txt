Acting without fear: Patricia Cornet, executive director, Patient Advocacy, hematology and oncology
In this month's episode, we are delighted to feature Patricia Cornet, executive director of Patient Advocacy in hematology and oncology. Hosting the episode is Bryant Powell, associate director of social media in Omni-Channel Capabilities and the host of the BOLD Innovators podcast series.
Pat leads the Patient Advocacy oncology, hematology and CAR-T team. Her primary focus is to amplify the patient voice and promote health equity perspectives within our company and the industry. She and her team develop strategies for key accounts while fostering a collaborative environment to strengthen internal and external partnerships. Their goal is to advance research, improve access and enhance patient education initiatives in cancer care. She is a founding member of Women of Color in Pharma (WOCIP), a non-profit organization that seeks to empower women of color in pharma to excel in their personal and professional development and to transform their pathway within the pharmaceutical industry.
During the interview, Pat shares an eye-opening moment from her career after returning to the U.S. from an assignment with BMS in China. She reflects on the importance of actively participating and having a seat at the table. In the past, she often found herself sitting at the back of the room and not fully leveraging her voice. She now realizes the significance of exerting oneself and actively engaging in discussions.
On urgency at work, Pat emphasizes the importance of self-awareness and self-knowledge. She suggests utilizing self-assessment tools to gain a deeper understanding of oneself. By knowing our strengths and weaknesses, especially in situations where urgency is not a natural trait, we can better navigate our professional journeys.

Never too late to start - a story of perseverance: featuring Awara Gbeblewo, senior manager, RCO, vendor operations and engagement
In this month’s episode, we have the pleasure of speaking to Awara Gbeblewo, senior manager, RCO, vendor operations and engagement. This episode was hosted by Bryant Powell, associate director, social media, Omni-Channel Capabilities, and host for the BOLD Innovators podcast series.
Awara leads a team of SRMs who are responsible for building and managing clinical site relationships for outsourced studies in Europe. Since joining BMS, Awara has been actively involved in inclusion and diversity initiatives. She founded and led the BOLD chapter in Switzerland for more than two years, was on the leadership team of the local B-NOW chapter and is now the co-lead for the BOLD LIFT program.
Awara shares her inspiring story of perseverance in the face of setbacks and adversities. She discusses her journey from being a first-year medical school student to selling camera lenses for a decade before returning to school and pursuing a career in life sciences, fulfilling a lifelong ambition.
When asked about moments of being boldly urgent in her career and personal life, Awara credits her mother and husband, both of whom have careers that require composure while being urgent. She draws motivation from them and emphasizes the importance of proper planning and anticipation, which leads to faster acceleration and efficient execution.
Awara’s biggest life lesson is always to have a contingency plan. She says, “Something I learned is to always have a Plan B even C and D, because if your first plan doesn't work, you need to have something else because otherwise you feel really helpless.”

She tells us that this did not limit her mum at all as she went to college on a basketball scholarship. Simply put, Angelique is boldly passionate about challenging expectations.
Angelique says “I think it instilled in me a real sense of you can do anything that you want to do, and that the only thing that really limits you is the box that you put yourself in.”

Stop coming out, be out: Paul Ashley, senior director, strategic engagement and inclusion
In this month’s episode, we have the pleasure of speaking with Paul Ashley, senior director, strategic engagement and inclusion within the Global Procurement Group at Bristol Myers Squibb.
Paul Ashley is a seasoned procurement leader with over 20 years of industry experience. Paul holds a bachelor of science in industrial engineering from Northwestern University, as well as a master of science in industrial operations and engineering from the University of Michigan.
Born and raised in Detroit, MI, the capital of the automobile manufactory industry, Paul Ashley decided to focus his higher education pursuits on engineering.  After grad school, Paul landed a job at IBM where he was first exposed to the field of procurement and his love of bringing diversity to companies' supply chains from business owners of color, the LGBTQ+ community and women.
When asked what Paul is boldly passionate about, he refers to his social media profile which demonstrates Paul is unapologetically black, gay and Christian. Paul is passionate about uplifting these communities by being an example of how to live the intersections of these communities freely.  “In times where I've had to navigate troubled waters is in the intersections of being, black, gay and Christian.”  Paul had to learn to fully embrace and love all of himself, unapologetically.  He advises others to “stop coming out, just be out and be who you are, and people will figure it out.”

Science, the final frontier: Akintunde Bello, senior vice president of clinical pharmacology, pharmacometrics, disposition and bioanalysis
In this month’s episode, we have the pleasure of speaking with Akintunde Bello or “Tunde,” senior vice president of clinical pharmacology, pharmacometrics, disposition and bioanalysis.
Originally from London, U.K., Tunde was born to Nigerian parents that emigrated to the UK in the late 1950s. Tunde is the middle child with two sisters.  London offered Tunde a very multicultural childhood with friends from all over the world from different cultures, nationalities and races. It was at school were Tunde fell in love with science. His love for science was further sparked as a keen watcher of natural history programs and with opportunities to examine wildlife and insects. As a lover of science fiction, Tunde loved watching the original Star Trek and even though the show wasn’t integrated, it reflected a future state where there wasn’t any prejudice, bigotry or things of that nature. Tunde’s love for sciences lead to his study of biomedical sciences after high school.
Tunde speaks about his passion for science and technology and its application for improvement of the world. His passion spans beyond the pharmaceutical space to include other technological advances in engineering, medical science and digital technologies. When deciding to move to the U.S. to further his career, he reflects on his and his wife’s decision to relocate, thinking if they don’t like it in the U.S. that they can go back in few years. Well 20 years later and two American daughters, they are still in the U.S. Tunde never regretted the decision to relocate because of the opportunities that have opened due to what he believes is the U.S. being the center of biopharmaceutical drug development. Tunde advises others considering a move to the U.S. to be thoughtful if the opportunity is a right fit for overall career goals, consider the impact on your family and starting over in a new country with a new culture.
As one of the few people of color within the pharmaceutical industry in the U.K., Tunde attributes his career success in part to his “village”. This village consisted of managers and colleagues along his career journey who clearly believed in him, offered support, insights and valuable career development advice. In fact, it was a former manager who was an advocate for his advancement where Tunde learned of the opportunity which led him to return to BMS in 2015 and to the executive director position heading up clinical pharmacology oncology.

Power of overcoming failure: Deepika Cattry, associate director, WW Commercialization – GU Cancers
In this month’s episode, we have the pleasure of speaking with Deepika Cattry, associate director, WW Commercialization – GU Cancers.
Growing up in New York as a second generation Indian American, Deepika Catty was the only minority in her high school and the first in her family to attend college. Although she faced challenges, it also fuels her desire to give back to other minority students, her community and eventually at Bristol Myers Squibb as the PAN STEM lead. As the PAN STEM Lead, Deepika can inspire, mentor and provide support to at risk and low-income individuals seeking STEM careers by helping set them up for a successful first year in school. She also speaks to the power of kindness. An act of kindness goes a long way, either in the board room or a smile in the office, it’s a simple yet powerful tool to being an inclusive leader.
Deepika shares her story of failure to triumph. Applying to medical school twice and not getting in, she still triumphed by securing a career which combined her love of science, research and business.   “Failure is hard to accept especially when it is not normalized in our day to day,” Deepika states.  She attributes her parents stressing the importance of hard work, dedication, and motivation to get through obstacles of failure. She also leaned on her mentors to gain the framework to map out what was the root cause of failing to learn from it.
Deepika shares of the value of allyship for all communities. During the attacks of 911, the community of Indian Americans who wore turbans were victimized. African Americans faced the same situation with Black Lives Matter. During the COVID-19 outbreak, people called the virus the “China” virus and the Asian American community was attacked. However, Deepika feels working at Bristol Myers Squibb gives all communities an opportunity to work together across the people business and resource groups and support each other in times of need or when their communities are facing challenges. “That is the time to raise your hand and be vocal about your story,” she says.  “It is by raising your hand to let others know you went through this situation that provides an opportunity for education on what they can do to improve the outcome and be a voice for allyship.”

Kindness is key: Wendy Short Bartie, chief of staff to the CEO
In this month’s episode, we have the pleasure of speaking with Wendy Short Bartie, chief of staff to the Chief Executive Officer, Giovanni Caforio.  Wendy’s professional career began as a public defender first in Washington, DC, and then in the Bronx, NY, where she was enjoyed helping the disenfranchised and underrepresented. Wendy’s desire to start a family and work less hours, while keeping a rewarding and fulfilling career, was the catalyst for a career shift to the pharmaceutical industry. Although the change in industries did not result in work that was less busy, Wendy was able channel her energies differently and focus on helping patients. She found the same enjoyment for helping people in a career in pharmaceutical as when she was working as a public defender. Wendy states, “knowing that every day I get to take a decision that ultimately can have the impact of allowing a man or woman to spend more time and better time with people that he or she loves is incredibly, incredibly rewarding.”
Wendy is exceptionally excited about the work Bristol Myers Squibb is doing in health equity. She states, “At Bristol Myers Squibb, innovation which is equally distributed means everyone can benefit from it.”  Wendy explains, “We should be in the business of helping all patients and it's critically important that everybody get access to innovation.”  Wendy claims health equity, at least in the U.S., rests in understanding social determinants of health as factors that need to be impacted long before somebody actually gets sick. By gaining an understanding of social determinate of health, such as education and food deserts, we are making good decisions that are inclusive to all communities.
In addition to being boldly passionate about helping disenfranchised, unrepresented and vulnerable people; Wendy is boldly passionate about kindness. She considers kindness to be acts we commit that helps someone else without expecting something in return. “One act of kindness, every day would make the world better place,” she states Wendy reflects on her own experience as a recipient of kindness shown to her by a leader from a former employer. When presenting a controversial topic at a leadership team meeting, Wendy found the only seat available to her was at the back of the room. The leader who noticed Wendy in the back of the room, invited Wendy to the front of the room asking everyone to make room for Wendy so that her opinions could be heard. Through this act of kindness, Wendy gained more confidence. She states, “You have the right to be in the room and have your opinions heard.”  Wendy pays it forward by making sure that everyone’s voice in the room are heard.

Panic or persevere featuring Rondu Vincent, executive director, Global Supplier Diversity and Sustainability.
In this month’s episode, we have the pleasure of speaking with Rondu Vincent, executive director, Global Supplier Diversity and Sustainability.
Growing up in both Queens, New York, and Plainfield, New Jersey, Rondu has seen homelessness, drugs and unemployment in his community. He realized early on he had a choice to either panic or persevere and decided to align with individuals who were more progressive. Rondu wouldn’t change his upbringing because it taught him resiliency and that he could rise above those circumstances. He credits his upbringing for making him a shrewd negotiator and eventually choosing a career in procurement. Rondu uses his procurement skills with a desire for servant leadership in a manner that elevates the Black, minority and underrepresented communities. He attributes Bristol Myers Squibb as a company that celebrates and appreciates differences with the resources to create real change. Rondu advises, if faced with a daunting task or negative circumstances, you must decide “do we panic and let it fester or do we persevere because we have a bigger role to play and impact to create.”
Rondu is boldly passionate about leveraging his platform to change lives of the underrepresented and marginalized. “I am fighting for something bigger than me. My goal is to talk myself out of a job,” said Rondu. “The day there is no longer a need for supplier diversity is the day diversity is part of the culture and society in general.” Rondu continues to challenge the status quo and is okay with being in difficult situations. He stated, “As long as we are being comfortable, I don’t think we are challenging the status quo enough.”
Rondu advises to make sure to give back in some way and don’t forget to “Reach back to pull up,” he states.  His work in the Power to Impact program is just one of the ways Rondu gives back and gives voices to diverse populations. The Power to Impact program’s influence goes beyond a procurement supplier diversity standpoint and reaches out to the community by hosting events such as health screening for the homeless and reading literacy.

Nnenna advises new career hires to always remember what it felt like to be new and as they progress in their career to have empathy for new colleagues.
Youssef was born in Morocco, Africa, and came to the U.S. at age 3.  Attending the Drexel University co-op program first led him to real world manufacturing experience in active pharmaceutical ingredients, biopharmaceutical manufacturing and opportunity in labs. Eventually, Youssef secured an internship opportunity through Pan Asian Network, a mentorship program at Bristol Myers Squibb. Youssef advises being comfortable with getting uncomfortable, whether that is trying something new, volunteering or mentoring and believes in making changes in the world around him where possible.

A servant leader: featuring Adam Taliaferro, director, Strategic Alliance lead, U.S. Policy & Government Affairs
In this month’s episode, we have the pleasure of speaking with Adam Taliaferro, director, Strategic Alliance lead, U.S. Policy & Government Affairs. Passionate about playing football, Adam was offered a scholarship to play at Penn State bringing him closer to realizing his dream of possibly playing professionally. At the fifth game in his freshman year against rival Ohio State, Adam made a routine helmet-to-helmet tackle that would change the course of his life. He had broken his neck — a similar injury suffered by the late Christopher Reeve. Given only a 3% chance of ever walking again, Adam fought insurmountable odds to not only walk, but to walk well.
Adam’s hope that he would walk again was fueled by the constant support of people, family and friends that encouraged him every day. “No one person can get through this type of injury by themselves,” Adam explains. His desire to help patients overcome adversary led to an advocacy position at Bristol Myers Squibb in U.S. Policy & Governance Affairs. Adam educates patient advocates on health policy and how to make their voices heard to state policy makers about the importance of access.

Bet on You: Featuring Monique Phillips, PBRG Lead, Black Organization for Leadership Development
In this month’s episode, we have the pleasure of speaking with Monique Phillips, PBRG lead, Black Organization for Leadership Development.
Joining as new lead for BOLD, Monique highlights BOLD’s Black History Month activities including keynote speaker Hill Harper, the focus on mental and physical health and wellness, and her gratitude of efforts from all the BOLD volunteers for making the Black History Month celebration a success.
As a recovering chemist, Monique shares the importance of asking “why” to get to root of problems and to viable solutions.  “Asking the question 'why’ helps solve most questions because we understand what is going wrong and what is going well, and you can fix that,” she explains.
As a BOLD Innovator, Monique expresses the importance of being optimistic and persistent.  After receiving many “Noes,” Monique’s persistence lead to a “Yes” to an opportunity to shadow a medical doctor during her training. She explained that sometimes we must be flexible and broaden our thinking on what is an acceptable “Yes.”  Finally, Monique explains the importance on betting on yourself and not being afraid to fail.

Connecting the Dots: Featuring Tony Rodriguez, Associate Director, GPS PMO Process & Governance.
In this month’s episode, we have the pleasure of speaking with Tony Rodriguez, Associate Director, GPS PMO Process & Governance. Tony is an accomplished, result focused, global enterprise certified program management professional, who is currently responsible for delivery of several critical Bristol Myers Squibb initiatives supporting global supply chain, global engineering and facilities and cell therapy. Tony has a BA in computer information systems from Branch College and an executive master’s degree in technology management from Stevens Institute of Technology.
Tony shares the importance of connecting the dots. Growing up in the Bronx, New York, he realizes it took a village to get him where he is today. He serves as a conduit for several Bristol Myers Squibb PBRGs to work together on common visions impacting multiple communities, such as health disparities and supporting future STEM talent and leaders. He believes it is important to nurture, support and provide examples to students considering a career in STEM, so they realize with hard work, a career in STEM is within their reach.
As an ally and BOLD innovator, Tony expresses the importance of seeing the big picture of the problem to be solved, recognizing strength in diverse perspectives, as key to connecting the dots. Tony explains connecting the dots entails building relationships with people, allowing people to be their authentic self, learning about other backgrounds and allowing yourself to be challenged in a good way by others who may think differently than you. By building these relationships, when you have problems you are not able to solve, you can call on your connections to find someone who may know the answer.

Mobile Mission: Featuring Amadou Diarra, Senior Vice President of Global Policies and Government Affairs
In this month’s episode, we have the pleasure of speaking with Amadou Diarra, Senior Vice President of Global Policies and Government Affairs. Amadou attributes his career success to being mobile and taking advantage of opportunities to work around the world in a variety of roles. He explains that being mobile takes the willingness to explore, understand and be open to others and other cultures. Working in another country, you must realize that you cannot expect to recreate the U.S. environment there.  One should embrace a cultural difference in an exchange for your own.  Amadou also advises when considering other roles, to network with individuals who are in the role or have done the role in the past to get a sense of what the role is about. Be intentional and take ownership to identify if the role is a fit in your development plan and really something you want to do.
