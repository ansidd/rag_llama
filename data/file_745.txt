1819
A LIFETIME OF INNOVATION IN SCIENCE AND MEDICINE BEGINS
Edward Robinson Squibb
was born in Wilmington, Delaware, on July 4, 1819.
Early in his life, Edward dreamed of becoming a physician. To make this possible, he served five years as an apothecary’s apprentice in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and from his meager pay he saves enough to enter Jefferson Medical College.
1845
EDWARD ROBINSON SQUIBB
Dr. Squibb graduates from Philadelphia’s Jefferson Medical College.
He spends a decade as a surgeon in the U.S. Navy, an experience that impresses upon him the urgent need for high-quality, standardized medicines.

1847
SQUIBB’S QUEST FOR PURITY
Dr. Squibb makes his mark as a forceful crusader against the impure drugs of the times. At the government’s request, he establishes a laboratory for the Naval Hospital in Brooklyn, New York, and serves as its director.
1852
ETHER PRODUCTION
While at the Naval Hospital, Dr. Squibb develops a better way to produce ether and shares his discovery with the rest of the medical community. His success at producing ether using steam distillation helps thousands of surgical patients who were suffering through operations without the benefit of anesthesia. Dr. Squibb is encouraged by the government to establish his own firm to aid the armed forces.

FIRST QUALITY CONTROL LAWS
Dr. Squibb receives appointment to the Committee of Revision of the U.S. Pharmacopeia. He indicates to committee members what formulas can be accepted, improved, or dropped altogether—creating a “quality control” for the first time.
1861–1865
SQUIBB MEDICINE CHEST
During the Civil War, Squibb manufactures compact, portable chests for military surgeons that contain an array of medicines and equipment—from ether and morphine to bandages and sponges. Each chest costs about $100, the equivalent of several thousand dollars today.

1862
FIRST DRUG REGULATIONS
With Dr. Squibb’s untiring concern for the use of quality drugs, he justifies his criticism of the American Pharmaceutical Society for its continued failure to enforce the Act of 1848—an Act which prohibits the import of adulterated drugs.
Dr. Squibb expands his business and construction begins on a new laboratory building on nearby Doughty Street in Brooklyn.
