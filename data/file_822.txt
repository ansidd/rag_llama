Shaping a Culture of Inclusion
Our Journey Ahead/EEO-1 Data
Our GD&I strategy is connected to the Bristol Myers Squibb business strategy, rooted in strategic long-term investments and driven by the continued commitment from leadership and our employees.
This
commitment to diversity and inclusion
drives us to be intentional in our strategy and to deliver better outcomes in service to our patients.
GD&I Strategic Areas of Focus
Today, our strategy reinforces how we address the changing needs of our patients and the growing challenge of health inequity. We’ve evolved our strategy to prioritize the following principles:
Bending the curve on representation
We focus on accelerating the progress made, particularly for executive women globally and underrepresented ethnic groups (UEGs) 1  in the U.S., where we have the greatest opportunity.
Shaping the culture of inclusion
We approach inclusion, authenticity and belonging with the same rigor as any other business objective.
Accelerating momentum with our People and Business Resource Groups (PBRGs)
We invest in a business model with dedicated full-time PBRG leaders who develop multi-year business plans to address the needs of our current and future workforce as well as our patients.
Driving external relationships with purpose
We are building a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) pipeline with the intent to attract promising talent and build trust with those communities where our patients live and work through strategic community-based partnerships.
Within the U.S., we’ve been a federal government contractor with affirmative action obligations for 50 years and have a long-standing commitment to equal employment opportunities.
