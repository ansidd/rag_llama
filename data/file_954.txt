Isibani Development Partners
Isibani Development Partners (IDP) is a South African NGO helping organizations in the health and social service sector of South Africa.
Need
Isibani works to meet the needs of South African communities through high-quality services in HIV, tuberculosis, and HIV-related illnesses. The principles of the Foundation’s ENGAGE-TB collaboration with the World Health Organization will guide the development of this project.
There is a strong need to continue building the skills and abilities of community-based organizations and Isibani will work with South African organizations struggling in the areas of HIV.
Project
Isibani will work with partners in four South African provinces to deliver services as well as support the South Africa TB Program in their fight against TB, HIV, and related diseases. They will develop training and tools for the partners and put into place a comprehensive referral network for healthcare services.
In collaboration with the Bambisanani Project, Isibani will introduce HIV and TB community awareness programs to hard-to-reach and poorly resourced communities. The Foundation’s Secure the Future Technical Assistance Program will help with monitoring and evaluation, integration of HIV and TB care and support, and data collection and documentation for mobilizing resources.
