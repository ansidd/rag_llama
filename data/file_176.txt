Novel cell-based therapies that use a person’s own cells are unlocking new potential in the fight against some of the most difficult-to-treat cancers. Cell therapy, which can consist of therapies made up of cells that are injected, implanted or grafted to treat disease, is one of several key areas of research at Bristol Myers Squibb. In particular, researchers are advancing the science of autologous chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, a type of cancer immunotherapy where a patient’s own T cells are genetically engineered to recognize and bind to proteins found on the surface of certain cancer cells. As a company on the forefront of scientific innovation, Bristol Myers Squibb is evaluating new and next-generation cell therapies and investing in technology to optimize the sophisticated manufacturing process.
