Facts and figures
Bristol Myers Squibb operates two facilities in Cambridge – an important hub of innovation for the company.
The R&D site at Kendall Square in Cambridge focuses on understanding the complexities of cancer resistance, with cross-functional scientific teams collaborating throughout the drug discovery and translational medicine continuum. The R&D site in nearby Alewife similarly focuses on discovery biology, translational science, and chemistry research as well as other important functions for a number of other diseases including various immune-mediated and fibrotic conditions.
Bristol Myers Squibb will be bringing those two sites together into a new building at Cambridge Crossing, with the move anticipated in the first half of 2023.
