Meet Dina
When Dina was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer, she didn’t go into fight mode right away. It was only after her doctor recommended a Bristol Myers Squibb clinical trial that she began to believe she could beat the disease. Her appreciation for those who supported her along her journey is matched only by her appreciation for every one of life’s milestones.
“
Life after cancer is truly never the same. You have a greater appreciation for each day, no matter what you're doing.
