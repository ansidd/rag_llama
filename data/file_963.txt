Touch Foundation
Touch Foundation is a non-profit organization working to improve the health of the Tanzanian population.
Need
Touch Foundation focuses on strengthening the overall health system in Tanzania and on developing sustainable solutions that can be replicated across sub-Saharan Africa.
The Bristol Myer Squibb Foundation’s prior support of the organization’s Lake Zone initiative helped lay the groundwork for Treat & Train, a network to educate health professionals and improve resource sharing. The organization is looking to implement this program locally to improve village healthcare delivery systems.
Project
Touch Foundation will support Masters in Public Health students who are doing research projects in rural areas of the Lake Zone. These students will identify local public health issues and design solutions to implement at the community level. Touch Foundation will identify key community organizations to collaborate on these projects and these communities and students will join the Treat & Train program.
