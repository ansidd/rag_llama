Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation: Specialty Care for Vulnerable Populations
This Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation national initiative seeks to improve and expand specialty care for low income and vulnerable people who are struggling with cancer, HIV, autoimmune diseases and cardiovascular diseases.
In 2015, the Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation launched the
Specialty Care for Vulnerable Populations
initiative
to address inequities in access to and utilization of specialty care services in the U.S. The goal of this national initiative is to improve and expand specialty care access, quality, and delivery by safety net providers and institutions. Foundation grantees and partners will develop and test innovative and sustainable models that work for medically underserved people facing cancers, HIV, autoimmune diseases or cardiovascular diseases.  Learn more about our Specialty Care for Vulnerable Populations initiative .
