Intended only for U.S. residents 18 years or older
Help understanding your coverage
What is and is not covered by your insurance can be hard to understand. We may be able to help you find out how your insurance plan covers your Bristol Myers Squibb prescription medicines. This includes benefits investigation and prior authorization support, as well as what your out-of-pocket costs might be.
Help with out-of-pocket costs
Even with insurance, affording medication can be difficult. If you have commercial insurance, we may be able to help you pay your out-of-pocket costs for prescribed Bristol Myers Squibb medicines.
Help with patient assistance
Some Bristol Myers Squibb medications are available free of charge. If you are struggling to make ends meet financially, do not have insurance that pays for your Bristol Myers Squibb medication, and meet other requirements, we may be able to help.
Patient support that speaks your language
Call center translation assistance for different languages
Translators are available in many languages. If you have been prescribed a BMS medication, contact your BMS patient program representative to learn more.
