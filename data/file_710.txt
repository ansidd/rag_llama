Growing up, Colleen’s older brother was the strongest person she knew—and their bond was even stronger. Then he was diagnosed with cancer. The disease and resulting treatments weakened him to the point where he was unrecognizable to Colleen. At Bristol Myers Squibb, Colleen does her part to ease the pain felt by family members when their loved ones are affected by cancer and other serious diseases.
