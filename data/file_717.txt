Meet Jim
All his life, Jim had been an active, happy and upbeat guy. But when he was diagnosed with a health condition, his quality of life began to suffer, which affected his emotional well-being. When Jim’s daughter – a Bristol Myers Squibb workforce – suggested he look into new treatment options, things took a rapid turn for the better. His quality of life was restored, and he was enjoying life as a grandfather again. The old Jim was back.
“
I feel like a part of the Bristol Myers Squibb family. They developed a product that treats the patient, as well as the condition, and for that I am extremely grateful.
