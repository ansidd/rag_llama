The Regents of the University of Michigan are piloting the Peer Advisors for Veteran Education (PAVE) which provides guidance and assistance to student veterans on issues that may arise during college life, and helps to ease the transition from the military to the university.
Need
Universities and community colleges are getting an influx of student veterans. Many who return from military service in combat zones have high rates of mental health symptoms, which can impede their academic progress. About 5 percent of veteran students drop out during their first year.
Supportive services can significantly improve student veterans’ ability to achieve academic goals, and numerous studies have demonstrated that peers can be a credible source of evidence-based practice regarding social support. Although grassroots peer programs are being implemented within the military, few have been formally evaluated and none are being implemented on a college campus.
Project
PAVE will serve student veterans on 10 college campuses across the nation by connecting them with peer advisors who will provide guidance and assistance on issues that may arise during college life, and improve their sense of connectedness and community. The program aims to improve the academic performance and increase student veteran retention rates. Evaluation and outcomes will demonstrate the feasibility effectiveness and impact of this student veteran peer-to-peer intervention.
