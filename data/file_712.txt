Working Together For Patients
Mike’s desire to help others started him on a career as a high school teacher and later to an IT job in healthcare. The change in profession was motivated in part by the revelation that his nephew had been diagnosed with a rare genetic disease that typically takes a patient’s life before the age of 30. With Mike’s nephew now 25, his condition is a constant reminder that the work Mike does in supporting discovery and development of new medicines is critically important to patients with unmet needs.
